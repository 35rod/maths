# TODO
- [x] negation operator!! negative numbers are annoying without it
- [x] insert multiplication operation between consecutive values between which there is no operation (so 3i would parse the same as 3*i)
- [x] variable assignment (statements?)
- [x] assigned variables in the prompt can't be accessed on a line past their definition as the right value, but they can as the left value (so `print{x}` would say `x` is undefined)
- [x] fix memory leaks caused by adding variable assignment (memory leaks for literally everything?), then rebase dev back into main
- [x] fix segfault when using `--set_var:` to insert a variable when the variable value string is empty (e.g. `--set_var:A=`)
- [x] syntax guide and other documentation
- [x] === operator for exact equality (do away with --no-estimate-equality)
- [x] interactive prompt (like python's IDLE) (pretty much done)
- [ ] add history to interactive prompt
- [x] fix 'ans' returning the last value evaluated rather than the output of the last prompt
- [x] change prompt to use MML_parse_stmts~~_to_ret~~ to maybe fix variables not working past their definition?
- [x] fix random memory leaks (probably caused by evaluator but I can't figure out the root cause)
- [x] fix the identifier 'a' having inexplicable bugs (--set_var doesn't work with it, it never flags an 'undefined variable' error even when it should, etc.)
- [x] vector literals have regressed; each element is (null) or the first thing that was evaluated (no idea why) (forgot to add a memcpy when transitioning to arena but we're good now)
- [ ] 'Nothing' type to return from stuff like `println` (basically `void`)
- [x] improve `MML_print_expr` to print the AST in a more similar format to the syntax used with `tests/ast_test.h`
- [ ] add Type type so I can add a `cast{type, val}` function
- [x] fix prompt so it reads data in 1 byte minimum chunks (now it's 8 bytes for one character read,
      so stdin doesn't work unless you're currently the one using the prompt via shell input or something) (thanks @35rod)
- [x] fix Ctrl+D not quitting prompt if the cursor isn't on the first character
- [?] add check for recursive variable definition (currently segfaults from stack overflow)
- [x] fix '~' operator not being used properly in the parser (reads past the end of PRECEDENCE, errors if optimizing with Debug or ReleaseSafe on `zig build`, but not if optimizing without safety, like with `make` or ReleaseFast)
- [ ] fix the bug shown in `tests/bug1.log` (probably only shows up with Debug or ReleaseSafe safety enabled)
- [x] support scientific notation in floating constants
