# TODO
[X] negation operator!! negative numbers are annoying without it <br />
[X] insert multiplication operation between consecutive values between which there is no operation (so 3i would parse the same as 3*i) <br />
[ ] variable assignment (statements?) <br />
[ ] add syntax & capability for using _Decimal128 to store a higher-precision number
[ ] library-capability (parse with a string with "$ident" variables whose values are inserted at some point later on) <br />
[ ] syntax guide and other documentation <br />
[ ] interactive prompt (like python's IDLE) <br />
