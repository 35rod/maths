# TODO
- [x] negation operator!! negative numbers are annoying without it <br />
- [x] insert multiplication operation between consecutive values between which there is no operation (so 3i would parse the same as 3*i) <br />
- [x] variable assignment (statements?) <br />
- [x] fix memory leaks caused by adding variable assignment (memory leaks for literally everything?), then rebase dev back into main <br />
- [x] fix segfault when using `--set_var:` to insert a variable when the variable value string is empty (e.g. `--set_var:A=`) <br />
- [x] syntax guide and other documentation <br />
- [x] === operator for exact equality (do away with --no-estimate-equality)
- [x] interactive prompt (like python's IDLE) (pretty much done) <br />
- [ ] add history to interactive prompt <br />
- [ ] fix random memory leaks (probably caused by evaluator but I can't figure out the root cause) <br />
- [ ] fix the identifier 'a' having inexplicable bugs (--set_var doesn't work with it, it never flags an 'undefined variable' error even when it should, etc.) <br />
