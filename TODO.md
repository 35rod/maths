# TODO
[ ] negation operator!! negative numbers are annoying without it
[ ] insert multiplication operation between consecutive values between which there is no operation (so 3i would parse the same as 3*i)
[ ] variable assignment (statements?) <br />
[ ] library-capability (parse with a string with "$ident" variables whose values are inserted at some point later on) <br />
[ ] syntax guide and other documentation <br />
