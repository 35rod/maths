# TODO
- [x] negation operator!! negative numbers are annoying without it <br />
- [x] insert multiplication operation between consecutive values between which there is no operation (so 3i would parse the same as 3*i) <br />
- [x] variable assignment (statements?) <br />
- [ ] assigned variables in the prompt can't be accessed on a line past their definition as the right value, but they can as the left value (so `print{x}` would say `x` is undefined) <br />
- [x] fix memory leaks caused by adding variable assignment (memory leaks for literally everything?), then rebase dev back into main <br />
- [x] fix segfault when using `--set_var:` to insert a variable when the variable value string is empty (e.g. `--set_var:A=`) <br />
- [x] syntax guide and other documentation <br />
- [x] === operator for exact equality (do away with --no-estimate-equality) <br />
- [x] interactive prompt (like python's IDLE) (pretty much done) <br />
- [ ] add history to interactive prompt <br />
- [x] fix 'ans' returning the last value evaluated rather than the output of the last prompt <br />
- [x] change prompt to use MML_parse_stmts~~_to_ret~~ to maybe fix variables not working past their definition? <br />
- [x] fix random memory leaks (probably caused by evaluator but I can't figure out the root cause) <br />
- [x] fix the identifier 'a' having inexplicable bugs (--set_var doesn't work with it, it never flags an 'undefined variable' error even when it should, etc.) <br />
- [x] vector literals have regressed; each element is (null) or the first thing that was evaluated (no idea why) (forgot to add a memcpy when transitioning to arena but we're good now) <br />
- [ ] 'Nothing' type to return from stuff like `println` (basically `void`) <br />
- [ ] improve `MML_print_expr` to print the AST in a more similar format to the syntax used with `tests/ast_test.h` <br />
