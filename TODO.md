# TODO
- [x] negation operator!! negative numbers are annoying without it <br />
- [x] insert multiplication operation between consecutive values between which there is no operation (so 3i would parse the same as 3*i) <br />
- [x] variable assignment (statements?) <br />
- [x] fix memory leaks caused by adding variable assignment (memory leaks for literally everything?), then rebase dev back into main <br />
- [x] fix segfault when using `--set_var:` to insert a variable when the variable value string is empty (e.g. `--set_var:A=`) <br />
- [x] syntax guide and other documentation <br />
- [ ] interactive prompt (like python's IDLE) (getting there) <br />
